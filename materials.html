            <p>Our products are made from a carefully chosen selection of sustainable materials.
                We are considering the whole
                life cycle of the product when choosing materials, trims and how to combine them. Sustainability and
                transparency
                are essentials in the product design, as well as for choosing the materials and suppliers. A detailed
                material

            <h2 class="h2_about">Organic cotton</h2>

            <div class="col-md-8 clearfix padding_about">
                <p> Organic cotton is grown without the use of toxic and persistent pesticides, synthetic
                    fertilizers or
                    insecticides, and GMO-seeds are not allowed. Chemicals used in conventional cotton farming are
                    among
                    the most toxic chemicals classified, and have a tremendous impact on the air, soil and water,
                    as
                    well as the health of farmers, people living in cotton farming areas, factory workers and the
                    development
                    of allergies. Organic cotton farming improves the land quality, prevents water contamination
                    and
                    conserves biodiversity and the health of the entire ecosystem.</p> <br><br>

                <p>We are using The Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)-certified organic cotton fabrics.
                    GOTS-certification
                    ensures the organic status of textiles, from harvesting of the raw materials through
                    environmentally
                    and socially responsible manufacturing all the way to labeling in order to provide credible
                    assurance
                    to the end consumer. Read more about GOTS-certification

            <div class="col-md-6 padding_about">
                <p>TENCEL™ is a brand name for a wood-based fiber which is also called lyocell, manufactured by the
                    Lenzing
                    AG. It's a strong fabric, which has a beautiful drape and good resistance to wrinkles.
                    Tencel lyocell is regenerated from wood cellulose of eucalyptus trees. It is similar in hand to
                    viscose/rayon
                    and bamboo, both regenerated fabrics.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 padding_about">
                <p> However, Tencel is one of the most environmentally
                    friendly
                    regenerated fabrics, for several reasons:</p>
                <li> <i class="fa fa-leaf"></i> Tencel™ fibers are derived from sustainable wood sources, natural
                    forests and sustainably
                    managed plantations. They have earned a Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification.</li>

                <li> <i class="fa fa-leaf"></i> The solvents used in the production process are non-toxic, and are able
                    to be re-used again
                    and again,
                    due to a technique called ‘closed loop’ spinning. Solvents are recycled 99,5% in the process.</li>
                <li> <i class="fa fa-leaf"></i> The fibre is completely biodegradable.</li>

        <div class="col-md-12">
            <h2 class="h2_about">Hemp</h2>

            <div class="col-md-6 clearfix padding_about">
                <p> Cannabis sativa is the scientific name of hemp. It is one of the fastest growing plants and was one
                    of the first plants to be spun into usable fiber. History of hemp fabrics goes way back -
                    archaeologists found a remnant of hemp cloth in ancient Mesopotamia which dates back to 8,000 BC.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>
                    Hemp plant demands very little; it grows like weed in small amount of land and requires very little
                    water (approximately 50% less than cotton). </p> <br><br>

            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6 clearfix padding_about">
                <p>The plant is naturally resistant to pests, so no toxic chemicals or pesticides are used in
                    cultivating hemp.
                    <br><br>
                    Hemp fiber is one of the strongest and most durable of all natural textile fibers. Not only is hemp
                    strong, but it also holds its shape, stretching less than any other natural fiber. The more hemp is
                    used, the softer it gets. Hemp doesn't wear out, it wears in. Hemp is also naturally resistant to
                    mold and ultraviolet light.

            <h2 class="h2_about">Recycled fabrics</h2>

            <div class="padding_about">
                <p>Textile waste can be divided into two categories, pre- and post-consumer
                    waste. Mahla Clothing is using both
                    types. This is a very environmental-friendly way, and a good example of practicing circular
                    economy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-6 clearfix padding_about">
                <h4>Post-consumer waste fabrics</h4>
                <p>Post-consumer waste is the material and clothing, which the consumer has purchased, most likely
                    worn
                    and then decided to put away. </p>

                <img src="images/rullerrr.jpg" alt="Roles of fabric" class="col-md-12 bomuld_billede_2">

                <p>These can be, e.g. broken, discarded or unwanted clothes and textiles. They are washed, cut
                    apart and
                    then cut again to a new shape and sewn into new products, which gives these textiles a whole
                    new
                    life. Clothing &amp; accessories made from post-consumer waste materials are often unique
                    one-of-a-kind
                    pieces.

            <div class="col-md-6 clearfix padding_about">

                <h4>Pre-consumer waste fabrics</h4>
                <p>Pre-consumer waste, also known as post-industrial waste, is the material left over from the
                    garment production.
                    We use several kinds of pre-consumer waste materials in our products, for example cutting
                    leftovers
                    and deadstock fabrics. </p><br><br>

                <p>Deadstock textiles are materials that are no longer useful for other factories and companies.
                </p> <br>

                <p>These fabrics end up unused for several different reasons; color/textile type is no longer in
                    season,
                    overstock, failure in the dyeing process, or textiles has slight damages that weren't worth
                    cutting
                    around in conventional garment manufacturing process, but can be avoided in a smaller scale
                    production.</p> <br><br>

                <p>
                    Using deadstock fabrics gives us a bigger variety of fabrics available. They are mostly used
                    for making limited editions,
                    small series and unique pieces. The deadstock used are handpicked from several sources, all
                    located
                    in Northern Europe.</p>
